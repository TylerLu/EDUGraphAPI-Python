# EDUGraphAPI - Office 365 Education Code Sample

In this sample, we show you how to integrate with school roles/roster data as well as O365 services available via the Graph API. 

School data is kept in sync in O365 Education tenants by [Microsoft School Data Sync](http://sds.microsoft.com).

## Sample Goals

The sample demonstrates:

- Calling Graph APIs, including:

  - [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/)
  - [Microsoft Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/)

- Linking locally-managed user accounts and Office 365 (Azure Active Directory) user accounts. 

  After linking accounts, users can use either local or Office 365 accounts to log into the sample website and use it.

- Getting schools, classes, teachers, and students from Office 365 Education:

  - [Office 365 Schools REST API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations)
  - A [Differential Query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-differential-query) is used to sync data that is cached in a local database by the SyncData Web Job.

This sample is implemented with the Python language and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework.

> [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

## Prerequisites

**Deploying and running this sample requires**:

- An Azure subscription with permissions to register a new application, and deploy the web app.

- An O365 Education tenant with Microsoft School Data Sync enabled

  - One of the following browsers: Edge, Internet Explorer 9, Safari 5.0.6, Firefox 5, Chrome 13, or a later version of one of these browsers.

  Additionally: Developing/running this sample locally requires the following:  

  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.5.2 or above
  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) 1.11 or above
  - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)

## Generate a self-signed certificate

A self-signed certificate is required by the SyncData WebJob. For preview, you may skip the steps below and use the default certificate we provided:

* Certificate file: `/webjobs/sync_data/app_only_cert.pfx`
* Password: `J48W23RQeZv85vj`
* Key credential: `/webjobs/sync_data/key_credential.txt`

For production, you should you own certifcate:

1. Generate a certificate with PowerShell

   Run PowerShell **as administrator**, then execute the commands below:

   ```
   $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature -Subject "CN=Edu App-only Cert" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyLength 2048
   ```

   > Note: please keep the PowerShell window open until you finish the steps below.

2. Get keyCredential

   Execute the commands below to get keyCredential:

   > Note: Feel free to change the file path at the end of the command.

   ```
   $keyCredential = @{}
   $keyCredential.customKeyIdentifier = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetCertHash())
   $keyCredential.keyId = [System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
   $keyCredential.type = "AsymmetricX509Cert"
   $keyCredential.usage = "Verify"
   $keyCredential.value = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())
   $keyCredential | ConvertTo-Json > c:\keyCredential.txt
   ```

   The keyCredential is in the generated file, and will be used to create App Registrations in AAD.

   ![](Images/cert-key-credential.png)

3. Export the certificate

   ```
   $password = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password" -AsSecureString
   Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -Password $password -FilePath c:\app_only_cert.pfx
   ```

### Introduction

**Solution Component Diagram**

![](Images/solution-component-diagram.png)

### **EDUGraphAPI**

**Authentication**

Django comes with a user authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. For more details, see [Django authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/).

Local users authentication is based on the built-in API:

* [authenticate](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.authenticate)
* [login](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.login)
* [logout](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.logout)

O365 users authentication is implemented with Open ID Connect. 

**Data Access**

In this sample, [Django's built-in ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/) is used to access data from the backend MySQL database.

Below are the tables:

| Table                          | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| auth_user                      | Django built-in user table which contains users' authentication information: username, email, password... |
| user_roles                     | Contains users' roles. Three roles are used in this sample: admin, teacher, and student. |
| profiles                       | Contains users' extra information: *favoriteColor*, *organization_id*,  *o365UserId*, and *o365Email*. The later two are used to connect the local user with an O365 user. |
| organizations                  | A row in this table represents a tenant in AAD.<br>*isAdminConsented* column records if the tenant consented by an administrator. |
| token_cache                    | Contains the users' access/refresh tokens.                   |
| classroom_seating_arrangements | Contains the classroom seating arrangements data.            |
| data_sync_records              | Stores data sync records like the delta link.                |

Models are defined in **/models/db.py**.

**Views**

Below are the views:

| Path                 | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| /account/views.py    | Contains views for users to register, login and logout. |
| /admin/views.py      | Contains administrative views like consent tenant, manage linked accounts. |
| /link/views.py       | Contains views used for link user accounts. |
| /management/views.py | Contains views of the about me page.     |
| /schools/view.py     | Contains education views, like schools, classes, and class details. |

**Decorators**

The below decorators were used in this app:

| Decorator         | Description                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| login_required    | Only allow logged in users to access the protected resources. |
| admin_only        | Only allow admins to access the protected resources. |
| linked_users_only | Only allow linked users to access the protected resources. |

**Services**

The services used by the server side app:

| Service          | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| UserService      | Contains method used to manipulate users in the database. |
| LinkService      | Contains method used to link user accounts. |
| AuthService      | Contains methods used for authorization and authentication. |
| AADGraphService  | Contains methods used to access AAD Graph APIs. |
| MSGraphService   | Contains methods used to access MS Graph APIs. |
| EducationService | Contains two methods to access Education REST APIs. |
| TokenService     | Contains method used to get and update tokens from the database |

The services are in the **/services** folder.

**Middleware**

**`HandleRefreshTokenExceptionMiddleware`** catches `RefreshTokenException` thrown by `TokenService` when refresh token does not exist or expired. Then it redirects the user to a page to let the user re-login.

**Multi-tenant app**

This web application is a **multi-tenant app**. In the AAD, we enabled the option:

![](Images/app-is-multi-tenant.png)

Users from any Azure Active Directory tenant can access this app. Some permissions used by this app require an administrator of the tenant to consent before users can use the app. Otherwise, users will see this error:

![](Images/app-requires-admin-to-consent.png)

For more information, see [Build a multi-tenant SaaS web application using Azure AD & OpenID Connect](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-multitenant-openidconnect/).

**SyncData WebJob**

The sync data WebJob is a standalone Python app. It is located in `/webjobs/sync_data` folder and will be deployed to `/App_Data/jobs/triggered/` folder of the Web App after the deployemnt.

This app was created to demonstrate differential query. Please checkÂ [Differential query](differential-query)Â section for more details.

### Office 365 Education API

The [Office 365 Education APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations) return data from any Office 365 tenant which has been synced to the cloud by Microsoft School Data Sync. The APIs provide information about schools, classes, teachers, students, and rosters. The Schools REST API provides access to school entities in Office 365 for Education tenants.

In this sample, the **Microsoft.Education** Class Library project encapsulates the Office 365 Education API. 

The **EducationServiceClient** is the core class of the library. It is used to easily get education data.

**Get schools**

~~~typescript
def get_schools(self):
    url = self.api_base_uri + 'education/schools'
    return self.rest_api_service.get_object_list(url, self.access_token, model=School)
~~~

~~~typescript
def get_school(self, object_id):
    url = self.api_base_uri + 'education/schools/%s' % school_id
    return self.rest_api_service.get_object(url, self.access_token, model=School)
~~~

**Get classes**

~~~typescript
def get_classes(self, school_id, top=12, nextlink=''):
    skiptoken = self._get_skip_token(nextlink)
    url = self.api_base_uri + "education/schools/%s/classes?$expand=schools&$top=%s&skiptoken=%s" % (school_id, top, skiptoken)
    return self.rest_api_service.get_object_list(url, self.access_token, model=Section, next_key='odata.nextLink')
~~~

```typescript
  def get_class(self, class_id):
        '''
        Get a section by using the object_id.
        <param name="object_id">The Object ID of the section.</param>
        '''
        url = self.api_base_uri + "education/classes/%s" % class_id
        return self.rest_api_service.get_object(url, self.access_token, model=Class)
```
**Manage Assignments**

        def get_assignments(self,class_id):
            '''
            Get assignments of a class.
            '''
            url = self.api_base_uri + 'education/classes/' +class_id + "/assignments"     
            return self.rest_api_service.get_object_list(url, self.access_token, model=Assignment)
```
    def add_assignment(self,class_id,name,dueDateTime):
        url = self.api_base_uri + 'education/classes/' +class_id + "/assignments"       
        data={"displayName":name,"status":"draft","dueDateTime":dueDateTime,"allowStudentsToAddResourcesToSubmission":"true","assignTo":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.educationAssignmentClassRecipient"}}
        return self.rest_api_service.post_json(url,self.access_token,None,data)
```

```
    def get_Assignment_Resources(self,class_id,assignment_id):
        url = self.api_base_uri + "education/classes/"+class_id+"/assignments/"+assignment_id+"/resources";
        return self.rest_api_service.get_object_list(url, self.access_token, model=AssignmentResource)
```

Below are some screenshots of the sample app that show the education data.

### Differential Query

A [differential query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-differential-query) request returns all changes made to specified entities during the time between two consecutive requests. For example, if you make a differential query request an hour after the previous differential query request, only the changes made during that hour will be returned. This functionality is especially useful when synchronizing tenant directory data with an applicationâ€™s data store.

The related code is in `/webjobs/sync_data/user_data_sync_service.py`.

Below is the log generated by the SyncData WebJob:

```
[05/10/2018 10:09:01 > 35fbc4: INFO] D:\local\Temp\jobs\triggered\sync_data\ffdz2cvn.5q5>D:\home\python353x64\python.exe start.py

```

### Authentication Flows

There are 4 authentication flows in this project.

The first 2 flows (Local Login/O365 Login) enable users to login in with either a local account or an Office 365 account, then link to the other type account. This procedure is implemented in the LinkController.

**Local Login Authentication Flow**

![](Images/auth-flow-local-login.png)

**O365 Login Authentication Flow**

![](Images/auth-flow-o365-login.png)

**Admin Login Authentication Flow**

This flow shows how an administrator logs into the system and performs administrative operations.

After logging into the app with an Office 365 account, the administrator will be asked to link to a local account. This step is not required and can be skipped. 

As mentioned earlier, the web app is a multi-tenant app which uses some application permissions, so tenant administrator must consent the app first.  

This flow is implemented in the AdminController. 

![](Images/auth-flow-admin-login.png)

**Application Authentication Flow**

This flow in implemented in the SyncData WebJob.

![](Images/auth-flow-app-login.png)

An X509 certificate is used. For more details, please check the following links:

- [Daemon or Server Application to Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-authentication-scenarios#daemon-or-server-application-to-web-api)
- [Authenticating to Azure AD in daemon apps with certificates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon-certificate-credential/)
- [Build service and daemon apps in Office 365](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/building-service-apps-in-office-365)

### Two Kinds of Graph APIs

There are two distinct Graph APIs used in this sample:

|              | [Azure AD Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api) | [Microsoft Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.io/) |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Description  | The Azure Active Directory Graph API provides programmatic access to Azure Active Directory through REST API endpoints. Apps can use the Azure AD Graph API to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on directory data and directory objects, such as users, groups, and organizational contacts | A unified API that also includes APIs from other Microsoft services like Outlook, OneDrive, OneNote, Planner, and Office Graph, all accessed through a single endpoint with a single access token. |
| Client       | Install-Package [Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/) | Install-Package [Microsoft.Graph](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/) |
| End Point    | https://graph.windows.net                | https://graph.microsoft.com              |
| API Explorer | https://graphexplorer.cloudapp.net/      | https://graph.microsoft.io/graph-explorer |

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Microsoft is investing heavily in the new Microsoft Graph API, and they are not investing in the Azure AD Graph API anymore (except fixing security issues).

> Therefore, please use the new Microsoft Graph API as much as possible and minimize how much you use the Azure AD Graph API.

Below is a piece of code shows how to get group documents from the Microsoft Graph API.

```typescript
def get_documents(self, object_id):
    url = self.api_base_uri + 'groups/%s/drive/root/children' % object_id
    return self.rest_api_service.get_object_list(url, self.access_token, model=Document)
```

Note that in the AAD Application settings, permissions for each Graph API are configured separately:
