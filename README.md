## Sample Goals

The sample demonstrates:

- Calling Graph APIs, including:

  - [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/)
  - [Microsoft Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/)

- Linking locally-managed user accounts and Office 365 (Azure Active Directory) user accounts. 

  After linking accounts, users can use either local or Office 365 accounts to log into the sample website and use it.

- Getting schools, sections, teachers, and students from Office 365 Education:

  - [Office 365 Schools REST API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations)

This sample is implemented with the Python language and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework.

> [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

## Understand the code

### Introduction

**Solution Component Diagram**

![](Images/solution-component-diagram.png)



### **EDUGraphAPI**

The server side app is based on Node.js and implemented with Typescript.

**Authentication**

Django comes with a user authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. For more details, see [Django authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/).

Local users authentication is based on the built-in API:

* [authenticate](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.authenticate)
* [login](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.login)
* [logout](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.logout)

O365 users authentication is implemented with Open ID Connect package: 

**Data Access**

In this sample, [Django's built-in ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/) is used to access data from the backend SQLite database.

Below are are tables:

| Table                        | Description                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Users                        | Contains the user's information: name, email, hashed password...<br>*O365UserId* and *O365Email* are used to connect the local user with an O365 user. |
| UserRoles                    | Contains users' role. Three roles are used in this sample: admin, teacher, and student. |
| Organizations                | A row in this table represents a tenant in AAD.<br>*IsAdminConsented* column records than if the tenant consented by an administrator. |
| TokenCache                   | Contains the users' access/refresh tokens. |
| ClassroomSeatingArrangements | Contains the classroom seating arrangements. |

You will find the **DbContext** class and related model interfaces in the **/data/dbContext.ts** file.

**Views**

The server app exposes several Web APIs:

| Path                 | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| /account/views.py    | Contains views for users to register, login and logout. |
| /admin/views.py      | Contains administrative views like consent tenant, manage linked accounts. |
| /link/views.py       | Contains views used for link user accounts. |
| /management/views.py | Contains views of the about me page.     |
| /schools/view        | Contains education views, like schools, classes, and class details. |

These APIs are defined in the **/routes** folder.

**Decorators**

Several decorators were used for authorization:

| Decorator |      |
| --------- | ---- |
|           |      |
|           |      |
|           |      |

**Services**

The services used by the server side app:

| Service           | Description                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| MSGraphClient     | Contains methods used to access MS Graph APIs |
| SchoolService     | Contains two methods: get/update seating arrangements |
| TenantService     | Contains methods that operate tenants in the database |
| TokenCacheService | Contains method used to get and update cache from the database |
| UserService       | Contains method used to manipulate users in the database |

The services are in the **/services** folder.

**Multi-tenant app**

This web application is a **multi-tenant app**. In the AAD, we enabled the option:

![](Images/app-is-multi-tenant.png)

Users from any Azure Active Directory tenant can access this app. Some permissions used by this app require an administrator of the tenant to consent before users can use the app. Otherwise, users will see this error:

![](Images/app-requires-admin-to-consent.png)

For more information, see [Build a multi-tenant SaaS web application using Azure AD & OpenID Connect](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-multitenant-openidconnect/).

### Office 365 Education API

The [Office 365 Education APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations) return data from any Office 365 tenant which has been synced to the cloud by Microsoft School Data Sync. The APIs provide information about schools, sections, teachers, students, and rosters. The Schools REST API provides access to school entities in Office 365 for Education tenants.

In this sample, the **Microsoft.Education** Class Library project encapsulates the Office 365 Education API. 

The **EducationServiceClient** is the core class of the library. It is used to easily get education data.

**Get schools**

~~~typescript
getSchools(): Observable<any[]> {
    return this.dataService.getArray<any>(this.urlBase + "/administrativeUnits?api-version=beta");
}
~~~

~~~typescript
getSchoolById(id: string): Observable<any> {
    return this.dataService.getObject(this.urlBase + '/administrativeUnits/' + id + '?api-version=beta');
}
~~~

**Get classes**

~~~typescript
getClasses(schoolId: string, nextLink: string): Observable<PagedCollection<any>> {
    let url: string = this.urlBase + "/groups?api-version=beta&$top=12&$filter=extension_fe2174665583431c953114ff7268b7b3_Education_ObjectType%20eq%20'Section'%20and%20extension_fe2174665583431c953114ff7268b7b3_Education_SyncSource_SchoolId%20eq%20'" + schoolId + "'" +
        (nextLink ? "&" + GraphHelper.getSkipToken(nextLink) : '');
    return this.dataService.getPagedCollection<any>(url);
}
~~~

```typescript
getClassById(classId: string): Observable<any> {
    return this.dataService.getObject<any>(this.urlBase + "/groups/" + classId + "?api-version=beta&$expand=members");
}
```
**Get users**

```typescript
getUsers(schoolId: string, nextLink: string): Observable<PagedCollection<any>> {
    var url = this.urlBase + "/administrativeUnits/" + schoolId + "/members?api-version=beta&$top=12" +
        (nextLink ? "&" + GraphHelper.getSkipToken(nextLink) : '');
    return this.dataService.getPagedCollection<any>(url);
}
```
Below are some screenshots of the sample app that show the education data.

![](Images/edu-schools.png)

![](Images/edu-users.png)

![](Images/edu-classes.png)

![](Images/edu-class.png)

In **/app/services/dataService.ts**, three generic methods simplify the invoking of REST APIs.

* **getObject<T>**: sends a http GET request to the target endpoint, and deserializes the JSON response string to T, and return the result object.  
* **getPagedCollection<T>**:  sends a http GET request to the target endpoint, and deserializes the JSON response string to PagedCollection<T>, and return the result object. 
* **getArray<T>**: sends a http GET request to the target endpoint, and deserializes the JSON response string to array, and return the array.

For http GET request sent by the 3 methods above, an access token is included in the bearer authentication header.

### Authentication Flows

There are 4 authentication flows in this project.

The first 2 flows (Local Login/O365 Login) enable users to login in with either a local account or an Office 365 account, then link to the other type account. This procedure is implemented in the LinkController.

**Local Login Authentication Flow**

![](Images/auth-flow-local-login.png)

**O365 Login Authentication Flow**

![](Images/auth-flow-o365-login.png)

**Admin Login Authentication Flow**

This flow shows how an administrator logs into the system and performs administrative operations.

After logging into the app with an Office 365 account,the administrator will be asked to link to a local account. This step is not required and can be skipped. 

As mentioned earlier, the web app is a multi-tenant app which uses some application permissions, so tenant administrator must consent the app first.  

This flow is implemented in the AdminController. 

![](Images/auth-flow-admin-login.png)

### Two Kinds of Graph APIs

There are two distinct Graph APIs used in this sample:

|              | [Azure AD Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api) | [Microsoft Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.io/) |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Description  | The Azure Active Directory Graph API provides programmatic access to Azure Active Directory through REST API endpoints. Apps can use the Azure AD Graph API to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on directory data and directory objects, such as users, groups, and organizational contacts | A unified API that also includes APIs from other Microsoft services like Outlook, OneDrive, OneNote, Planner, and Office Graph, all accessed through a single endpoint with a single access token. |
| Client       | Install-Package [Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/) | Install-Package [Microsoft.Graph](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/) |
| End Point    | https://graph.windows.net                | https://graph.microsoft.com              |
| API Explorer | https://graphexplorer.cloudapp.net/      | https://graph.microsoft.io/graph-explorer |

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Microsoft is investing heavily in the new Microsoft Graph API, and they are not investing in the Azure AD Graph API anymore (except fixing security issues).

> Therefore, please use the new Microsoft Graph API as much as possible and minimize how much you use the Azure AD Graph API.

Below is a piece of code shows how to get "me" from the Microsoft Graph API.

```typescript
public getMe(): Promise<any> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        request
            .get(Constants.MSGraphResource + "/v1.0/me/?$select=id,givenName,surname,userPrincipalName,assignedLicenses")
            .set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + this.accessToken)
            .end((err, res) => {
                if (err) { return reject(err) }
                resolve(res.body);
            })
    })
}
```

Note that in the AAD Application settings, permissions for each Graph API are configured separately:
